/**
 * The object used as items in locations. This is based on the supported interface for items in Atom
 * panes. That way, we maintain compatibility with Atom (upstream?) and can put them in panes as-is.
 *
 * The truth is that these models can have any methods they want. Packages define ad-hoc protocols
 * and check to see if the item implements them. For example, atom-tabs will call `getIconName()` if
 * it exists. We have some of our own optional methods which, for clarity's sake, are defined here,
 * even though they're only used by some of our location packages.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: All properties and methods must be optional so that we maintain compatibility with
 * non-nuclide items.
